# MyReads Project
The project contained in this repository is the "My Reads" project, which is the first of the three projects in the Udacity Front-end Nanodegree Program. The application is basically for keeping track of books. It categorizes books into three sections, namely: 
- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- and Read

# How to Run
You need to have node installed on your local machine to run this application. After installing node, you can open your terminal (or command prompt for Windows)
and run the following commands:

npm install
npm start

The application should launch in your browser at this point. If not, open your default browser and navigage to http://localhost:3000.

# Using the Application
The home page of this application displays a list of books in three categories (mentioned above). You can use the arrow button to move a book between shelves. Click on the shelf name to hide a shelf from view, and click again to show the shelf.

To search for specific books based on author or title, click on the 'Search' link at the bottom right of the page; this will display the list of books corresponding to your query. If your query does not return a result, a message is displayed indicating that no titles were found.
