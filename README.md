# MyReads Project
This is the "MyReads" project through the Udacity Front-end Nanodegree Program. Its functional purpose is to categorize books between books you are currently reading, want to read, and have read, as well as giving you a search feature to search for books.

# How to Run
To run this application, just clone it to your local machine, and make sure you have npm installed.

In your console, type:

npm install
npm start
The application should launch in your browser at this point. If not, open your default browser and navigage to http://localhost:3000.

# Using the Application
The first page is the books/shelves list. You can use the arrow button to move a book between shelves. Click on the shelf name to hide a shelf from view, and click again to show the shelf.

If you click on the 'Search' on the bottom right of the document, it will bring you to the search page. Here, you can search for books, and add it to one of your shelves.
